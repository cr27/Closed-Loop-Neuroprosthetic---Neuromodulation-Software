# Closed-Loop-Neuroprosthetic---Neuromodulation-Software
This repo contains arduino and python code that demonstrates a proof-of-concept for Deep Brain Stimulation based neuromodulation using pulse width, frequency, and voltage passed back and forth (Encoding and Decoding) from the arduino IDE(Neuroprosthetic) and python IDE (Computer)
